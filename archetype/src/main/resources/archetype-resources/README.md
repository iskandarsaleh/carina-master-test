### Carina
Carina is a Java-based framework developed to simplify test automation process. Frameworks combines functionality for **Web**, **Mobile**, **WebService** and **DB** testing. Carina allows to implement robust integrational test scenarios that covers all aspects of application, for example you may prepare some test data in DB then go and interact with Web UI, after that make some WebService API calls and finally verify Mobile app changes. All that possible using Carina framework! It uses multiple open source frameworks under the hood:
* [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) - portable software testing framework for web applications that supports most of the browsers
* [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) - test automation framework for native and hybrid mobile apps both for iOS and Android
* [MyBatis](https://github.com/mybatis/) - persistence framework that couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using an XML descriptor or annotations
* [Freemarker](https://github.com/freemarker/) - template engine that allows to dynamicly generate WebService requests and repornces
* [TestNG](https://github.com/cbeust/testng) - testing framwork that helps to organize test cases and test suites
* [Apache Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven) - project build tool
